		# Step Two Tasks:
		1. Wrap app in a container with a white BG that is full
		   width until it reaches 800px and then it's center
		   column with grey sides
		2. This app container (white column with gray sides)
		   stretches the full height of the browser without any
		   scroll issues and can handle overflow without visual
		   defects
		2. Tasks are now two column for desktop > 600px
		3. Tasks flow left to right
		   1 | 2
		   3 | 4
		4. Tasks cannot overlap, collide and order is preserved
		   no matter the length of text
		5. When "mobile size" or narrower is reach, tasks go to
		   single column
		NOTES: Start with mobile first. Plus, there are multiple ways to produce columns. The
		key to this task is think about preserving "document
		flow". Preserving document flow is key to creating
		resilient UIs.
